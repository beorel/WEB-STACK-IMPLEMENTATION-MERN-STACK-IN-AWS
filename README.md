# WEB-STACK-IMPLEMENTATION-MERN-STACK-IN-AWS
In this project, you are tasked to implement a web solution based on the MERN stack in AWS Cloud.

MERN Web stack consists of the following components:

1. MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.
2. ExpressJS: A server-side Web Application framework for Node.js.
3. ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.
4. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

### *Side Self Study*
1. Make research what types of [Database Management Systems (DBMS) exist and what each type is more suitable for](https://www.alooma.com/blog/types-of-modern-databases). 
Be able to explain the difference between Relational DBMS and NoSQL (of a different kind).
2. Get yourself familiar with a concept of [Web Application Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework). Get to know what server-side (backend) and client-side (frontend) frameworks exist and what they are used for.
3. [Practice basic JavaScript syntax just for fun](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp).
4. Explore what [RESTful API](https://restfulapi.net/) is and what it is used for in Web development.
5. Read what [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) is used for and browse [basic syntax and properties](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
